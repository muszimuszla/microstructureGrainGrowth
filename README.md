# microstructureGrainGrowth

Implementation of a microstructure grain growth with the use of C# and WFA. Apllication is prepared for generating microstructures with set parameters and simulating the nucleation and grain growth with Cellular Automata Alghoritm or Monte Carlo Alghoritm. It also allows for simulate dual phase microstructure and recrystallization process.
